## Input Parameters for a Monitoring Plugin
A _Monitoring Plugin_ MUST expect input parameters as arguments during execution, if any are needed/expected at all. It MAY accept these parameters
given as _environment variables_ and it MAY accept them in a configuration file (with a default path or a path given via arguments or _environment variables_).

In general positional arguments are strongly discouraged.

Some arguments MUST have this predetermined meaning, if they are used:

| Argument (long) | Argument (short version, optional) | Argument | Meaning | optional | can be given multiple times |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| --help | -h | None | "Triggers the help functionality of the _Monitoring Plugin_, showing the individual parameters and their meaning, examples for usage of the _Monitoring Plugin_ and general remarks about the how and why of the _Monitoring Plugin_. SHOULD overwrite all other options, meaning, they are ignored if `--help` is given. The _Monitoring Plugin_ SHOULD exit with state UNKNOWN (3). | no | -- (makes no difference) |
| --version | -V | None | Shows the version of the _Monitoring Plugin_ to allow users to report errors better and therefore help them and the developers. The _Monitoring Plugin_ SHOULD exit with state UNKNOWN (3). | no | -- (makes no difference) |
| --timeout | -t | Integer (meaning seconds) or a time duration string | Sets a limit for the time which a _Monitoring Plugin_ is given to execute. This is there to enforce the abortion of the test and improve the reaction time of the _Monitoring System_ (e.g. in bad network conditions it might be helpful to abort the test prematurely and inform the user about that, than trying forever to do something which won't succeed. Or if soft real time constraints are present, a result might be worthless altogether after some time). A sane default is probably 30 seconds, although this depends heavily on the scenario and should be given a thought during development. If the execution is terminated by this timeout, it should exit with state UNKNOWN (3) and (if possible) give some helpful output in which stage of the execution the timeout occurred. | no | no |
| --hostname | -H | String, meaning either a DNS name, an IPv4 or an IPv6 address of the targeted system | If the _Monitoring Plugin_ targets ONE other system on the network, this option should be used to tell it which one. If the _Monitoring Plugin_ does it's test just locally or the logic does not apply to it, this option is, of course, optional. | yes | yes |
| --verbose | -v | None | Increases the verbosity of the output, thereby breaking the suggested rules about a short and concise output. Can be used to debug the _Monitoring Plugin_ and should there expose internals, intermediate results and so on. | yes | yes |
| --detail | | None | Increases the level of detail in the output, thereby giving the user more information about the result of the test and helping with determining errors and problems or just satisfy some curiosity. SHOULD NOT be used to debug the _Monitoring Plugin_, so there is no need to expose internals. | yes | yes |
| --exit-ok | | The _Monitoring Plugin_ exits unconditionally with OK (0). Mostly useful for the purpose of packaging and testing plugins, but might be used to always ignore errors (e.g. to just collect data). | yes | no |

### Examples
For the execution with `--help`:
```
$ my_check_plugin --help
```
the output might look like this:
```
my_check_plugin version 3.1.4
Licensed under the AGPLv1.
Repository: git.example.com/jdoe/my_check_plugin

This plugin just says hello. It fails if you don't give it a name.

Usage:
 my_check_plugin --name NAME [--greeting GREETING]

Options:
 --help
   this help
 --version
   Shows the version of the plugin
 --name NAME
   if given, uses NAME as a name to greet.
 --greeting GREETING
   if given, uses GREETING instead of Hello.

Examples:
$ my_check_plugin --name Jane
Hello Jane

$ my_check_plugin --greeting Ciao --name Alice
Ciao Alice
```
This imaginary _Monitoring Plugin_ tries to be really helpful here,
displays the version, the license and the upstream repository with the help
(although not necessary), has a short description about the purpose,
lists the options in an easily readable way and even gives some examples.

For the execution with `--version`
```
$ my_check_plugin --version
```
the output might be a bit shorter:
```
my_check_plugin version 3.1.4
```
or even:
```
3.1.4
```
where both show the necessary information.
