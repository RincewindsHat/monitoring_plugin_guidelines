## The basic Monitoring Plugin usage
A Monitoring System executes a Monitoring Plugin. The Monitoring Plugin MAY accept parameters in
the form of command line arguments, environment variables or a configuration file (the location of which
MAY in turn be given on the command line or via environment variable).
The Monitoring Plugin then proceeds to execute it's duty and returns the result to the Monitoring System.
Part of the process of returning the result is the termination of the execution of the Monitoring Plugin itself.
