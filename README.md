# The Monitoring Plugin Interface

This repository aims to provide a project and language independent definition
of the _Monitoring Plugin_ interface as a point of reference and a starting point
for future developments.

It intends to help to write plugins which are compatible with the plethora
of _Monitoring Systems_ which are similar to Nagios, are easy to use and useful
for users of those _Monitoring Systems_.

The document is split into different parts to separate different topics
(if possible) and make searching and changing parts easier.
