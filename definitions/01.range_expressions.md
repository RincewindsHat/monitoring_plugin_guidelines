## Range expressions

In many cases thresholds for metrics mark a certain range of values where the values is considered to be good or bad if it is inside or outside.
While for significant number of metrics a upper (e.g. load on unixoid systems) or lower (e.g. effective throughput, free
space in memory or storage) border might suffice, for some it does not, for example a temperature value from a temperature
sensor should be within certain range (let's say 10℃ and 45℃).

Regarding input parameters this might be handled with with options like `--critical-upper-temperature` and `--critical-lower-temperature`,
this presents a problem with the performance data, if only scalar values could be used.
To resolve this situation the _Range expression_ format was introduced, with the following definition:

`[@][start:][end]`
where:
 1. `start` <= `end`
 2. If `start` == 0, then it can be omitted.
 3. If `end` is omitted, it has the "value" of positive infinity.
 4. Negative infinity can be specified with `~`.
 5. If the prefix `@` is NOT given, the value exceeds the threshold if it is OUTSIDE of the range between `start` and `end` (including the endpoints).
 6. If the prefix `@` IS given, the value exceeds the threshold if it is INSIDE the range between `start` and `end` (including the endpoints).
 7. Contrary to the short definition above, an empty _Range expression_ is not a valid one, at least either `start` or `end` must be provided.

### Examples

| Range definition | Exceeds threshold if x...|
| --- | --- |
| 10 | < 0 or > 10, (outside the range of {0 .. 10}) |
| 10: | < 10, (outside {10 .. ∞}) |
| ~:10 | > 10, (outside the range of {-∞ .. 10}) |
| 10:20 | < 10 or > 20, (outside the range of {10 .. 20}) |
| @10:20 | ≥ 10 and ≤ 20, (inside the range of {10 .. 20}) |
